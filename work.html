The first part of the project will focus on providing an efficient implementation of ray-scene geometry queries. In the second half of the project I added the ability to simulate how light bounces around the scene, which will allow the renderer to synthesize much higher-quality images.

The original version of this application contains 4 scenarios, and our main purpose is to embed Google Map to it. My current work includes displaying area map with Google Map API in payload window according to input latitude and capturing map information for the following interactive purposes.

										<br/>
										The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. One reason that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats. We are presenting a visualized information of data in more interesting way: passengers with attributes, such as age, name, class, gender, etc., and the outcome: survival or not. We also developed a prediction game based on the model.

										<br/>
										Making best use of clinical datasets has been the focus of machine learning in many clinic related research due to the limited clinical samples, and there are extensive research have been carried out in diseases classification and prediction using prior clinic data. We specifically addressed how to best select the features of three different datasets (heart diseases data) which have 75 attributes but have different level of missing data for certain variables. Also, we want to balance between the dimension reduction and model performance. We used our best-selected variables to compare the efficiency of different classification techniques. After applying variable processing method, generally, the performance of classification techniques has been improved and some key features which were ignored by previous research, are identified to play a key role in improving classification model performance.

											BVW Photobooth is an interactive Kinect 2 experience developed in three weeks. Our team selected seven scenes from courses projects, and added interactive elements to these scenes. Players can choose either scene, and experience different interactivties. Four photos will be taken, and we will genereate animated photos(.gif) for the players in real-time. We also have a web site to show all photos. Players will get a code at the end of this experience. With the code, they can go to the web site to download, share on Facebook or email their photos.

There are three levels in the game. The player will become the Mountain and rotate the ground with their hands (using Kinect detection) to help the carbon rock travel underground, overcome difficulties, meet other rocks, and finally erupt from a volcano becoming a diamond in the end.

Since it is a traditional game, the interface has been designed in a very user-friendly way. Two characters on the left can easily show the players whose turn right now, and identify the color of the chessman. After one play win the game, a message with the results will pop-up on the screen, and say ‘play’ again to start another game.
