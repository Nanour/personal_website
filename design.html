											<br/>
											BVW Photobooth is an interactive Kinect 2 experience developed in three weeks. Our team selected seven scenes from courses projects, and added interactive elements to these scenes. Players can choose either scene, and experience different interactivties. Four photos will be taken, and we will genereate animated photos(.gif) for the players in real-time. We also have a web site to show all photos. Players will get a code at the end of this experience. With the code, they can go to the web site to download, share on Facebook or email their photos.

											<br/>
											Developed a Gomoku game with the Microsoft speech API and Visual Basic. Players can easily say ‘play’ to start the game, and speak two numbers(row and column) to locate the chessman. Since it is a traditional game, the interface has been designed in a very user-friendly way. Two characters on the left can easily show the players whose turn right now, and identify the color of the chessman. After one play win the game, a message with the results will pop-up on the screen, and say ‘play’ again to start another game.
