										<br/>
										The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. One reason that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats. We are presenting a visualized information of data in more interesting way: passengers with attributes, such as age, name, class, gender, etc., and the outcome: survival or not. We also developed a prediction game based on the model.

										Designed and generate proper information visualization according to requirements. In case one, time-series plot, bar charts and maps have been generated to illustrate information. In case two, node-link graphs and matrix have been designed and generated to demostrate relations between information. All the graphs are implemented with D3.

										<br/>
										Making best use of clinical datasets has been the focus of machine learning in many clinic related research due to the limited clinical samples, and there are extensive research have been carried out in diseases classification and prediction using prior clinic data. In our paper, we specifically addressed how to best select the features of three different datasets (heart diseases data) which have 75 attributes but have different level of missing data for certain variables. Also, we want to balance between the dimension reduction and model performance. We used our best-selected variables to compare the efficiency of different classification techniques. After applying variable processing method, generally, the performance of classification techniques has been improved and some key features which were ignored by previous research, are identified to play a key role in improving classification model performance.
