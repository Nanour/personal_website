											<br/>
										The goal of this project is to create new games for Anki's Cozmo robot so that Cozmo will arrive into consumers' lives with the ability to play a variety of games. The primary focus is to take advantage of Cozmo's capabilities in unique and engaging ways.

											<br/>
										In our final project, we extend the previous physically-based renderer assignment, and construct a fully parallel BVH to improve performance of BVH construction. In particular, the time of constructing a dragon decreased from 5.2194 sec to 0.0855 sec.

											<br/>
										In this project, I implemented a simple path tracer that can render pictures with global illumination effects. The first part of the project will focus on providing an efficient implementation of ray-scene geometry queries. In the second half of the project I added the ability to simulate how light bounces around the scene, which will allow the renderer to synthesize much higher-quality images.

										Volume Browser(created at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center) enables users to view large three dimensional images (datasets) over the internet. Users can interact with the image to view from any angle, or slice through it to see inside. My current work is to modify the interactive interface, which includes adjust zoom level, re-design rotate methods and re-arrange components to make it more user-friendly. I also update files to make it work on Linux, Windows and MacOS platforms.

										RESCHU(developed by MIT) is a Java-based simulation that allows a single operator to control a team of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs), composed of unmanned air and underwater vehicles (UAVs and UUVs). The original version of this application contains 4 scenarios, and our main purpose is to embed Google Map to it. My current work includes displaying area map with Google Map API in payload window according to input latitude and capturing map information for the following interactive purposes.

										<br/>
										The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. One reason that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats. We are presenting a visualized information of data in more interesting way: passengers with attributes, such as age, name, class, gender, etc., and the outcome: survival or not. We also developed a prediction game based on the model.

The system supports functions like conditions search, add ,edit, delete, etc., and it also integrates Google Calendar, helping users to manager their schedule. It also supports RSS, therefore users can easily get updates information from the Research Center.

										Developed a management system for the Digital Sales Corporation. Designed the database according to the customerâ€™s requirements, and create proper tables with the correct and logical relations in the database. This database consists of more than 1000,000 items and the system supports functions like conditions search, add, delete, update, etc. Users can log into the system as a customer, a salesperson or a manager, but only the managers can change modify the sales information. Customers can purchase products through the system, and salesperson can submit the new tickets to the system.
